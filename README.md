# Getting Started with Authentication App

## This app is about authentication. From this app, users can create an account and after creating an account, they can Login to their account. 
### I've used here Google firebase authentication system.

### To run the project we have to run command
 * npm start or npm run start

### To make the Login or Signup workable, we have to register a project in firebase and then connect the config file with the project.
